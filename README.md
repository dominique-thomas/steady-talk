# Steady Talk

**Steady Talk** is a browser-based interview simulation designed to help individuals practice and refine their conversational and soft skills in a low-pressure environment. Users can engage in mock interviews across different stages using natural voice input, guided mentor feedback, and AI-driven insights.

## Features
- Voice recognition for natural, in-browser interview responses  
- Fictional companies and industries to make each practice session dynamic  
- Mentor feedback and summaries highlighting pacing, keyword usage, and overall confidence  
- Downloadable transcripts and media for reflection and self-review  
- Supports multiple interview stages (Prescreen, Hiring Manager, and Team Fit)

## Purpose
This project was developed to explore how browser-based technology and instructional design can make interview preparation more interactive and accessible. **Steady Talk** provides a safe, low-risk environment for users to practice answering real-world interview questions, improve communication, and build confidence over time.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Web Speech API for browser-based voice recognition  
- TensorFlow.js (for future posture and gesture tracking)
